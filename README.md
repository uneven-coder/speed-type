# Speed Typing

This is a starter project to help me get into learning typescript.

it has mobile and pc views, uses a custom display and input manager to create the quote view and get user input. this lets me style letters and peform checks on user input and block bad inputs like cheating and state management.

made in next js exported to static html to work on github pages

## Lessons Learned

I have already used NextJS before but i mainly did the website and react size. So for this project i wanted to docus more on programing and logic.

Workign with Typescript was annoying, meaning its everything i expected, coming from c#, c++ and python the almost structure less format js/ts is, its very diffrent. It makes deciding how to structure functions dificult i often wonder where to start the function, and the even driven nature made me question how to start one off functions.

I also found it hard to understant how to edit elements, but i soon found out and found it nice, i also finaly learnt css data/query selectors so that will help with other projects.

## Roadmap

- I would like to revisit this project and so i will leave out features so when i improve i can come back and remake. The following features will be for that version.

- Add more typing modes:
    - Gibberish
    - Random Word's
    - Custom
    - Endless
    - Code
    - pc and mobile views are diffrent components
